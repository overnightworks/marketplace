Reusable policy is owned by `instructions/AGENTS.md` in this repository; this
file restates it for readers in this tree, and a change to the owner lands here
in the same session. Keep project facts, provider glue, architecture
state, tool commands, and plans outside it.

Entry points (pointers only; the facts live there): `README.md` owns the plugin
layout, source-versus-generated ownership, installation, update, and verification
commands.

Treat existing tracked and untracked changes as the operator's work: preserve
them and work around them. Never use `git stash` in a worktree because its
stash stack is shared across worktrees; commit lane work on its branch
instead.

## Growth

Grow the repository only to remove a named problem, preserve a real invariant,
or enable a named capability. Reuse an existing owner before creating one.

Keep facts compact and verified. Check repository claims against files and
external claims against primary sources. Mark unknowns.

Do not duplicate guidance. Update the owner.

No new item without a named caller, and no hardening without usage evidence
(operator ruling 04.09.2026).

A rule a machine can check belongs in the repository's checks, not in a sentence
every agent must remember. What only judgement can see belongs to a scheduled
agent audit at a fixed cadence, and one audit run yields one distributor item.

An index, vector store, or knowledge graph over the code needs a named consumer
and a measurement that beats plain search; localisation is a measured problem,
not an assumed one.

## Code

- Identify the owner, state, configuration, failure modes, and verification
  before editing.
- Fix the cause, not the symptom. Use temporary containment only when the risk
  is named, visible, verified, and has a removal path.
- Create a new boundary only when no existing owner can honestly own the
  decision.
- Do not add architecture, extension points, compatibility layers, or options
  without a current caller.
- Build vertically first: shapes early, surfaces thin, hardening after use. A
  capability's first slice is the thinnest honest end-to-end proof; edge cases
  are mandatory before that first run only where their absence corrupts durable
  state, loses data, or lets the system lie. Every other edge is deferred by
  naming it — an open sentence or named gap on the owning item — and waits for
  usage evidence. A review judges the slice against its declared sentences, not
  against all conceivable hardness. (Operator + coordinator ruling, 16.08.2026.)
- Keep a slice inside three production files and a hundred changed production
  lines — additions and deletions counted apart, tests and generated files
  excluded. Above that corridor the dispatch names in one sentence why the
  change does not split; the corridor is reported, never gated, because a check
  cannot judge a cut.
- Generate what a generator produces deterministically, for declared derived
  artefacts only; once its generator exists, an empty regeneration diff is the
  gate.
- Code reached only by tests is dead code: reachability counts from real
  entry points — composition root, routes, CLI, workflows — and a test is not
  a caller (operator ruling 04.09.2026).
- Code built ahead of its caller is frozen, not deleted: it stays in the tree,
  gets no hardening and no new tests, keeps the tests it has, and is listed
  against the item that names its caller. It is deleted when no item names one
  (operator ruling 04.09.2026).
- Match existing style unless it conflicts with this file or preserves a known
  defect.
- Use readable, fully written names. Avoid abbreviations unless established.
- Prefer typed state over loose dictionaries and string protocols.
- No direct `Any` parameter in the contract, port, application, and API layers.
  `ANN401` proves exactly that and nothing more: a nested `dict[str, Any]` stays
  counted debt that must not grow.
- Put behavior with the module that owns the decision.
- Keep side effects visible at the call site.
- Keep pure logic pure when side effects are not part of the contract.
- Isolate filesystem, process, network, clock, randomness, and external
  services behind narrow boundaries.
- Use comments only for unavoidable why: external constraints, security reasons,
  protocol quirks, data-loss risks, or non-obvious tradeoffs.
- Keep ageing narrative out of changed source lines: a new comment or docstring
  does not carry "formerly", "superseded", "replaced X with Y", "since PR", a
  date, or an issue number as provenance. A durable reason citing a decision
  record stays allowed.
- Fix scanner and linter findings in code. An exception exists only after a
  code route was tried and measured or judged counterproductive; it is
  versioned in the repository next to its reason (a rule-specific line marker
  or a properties entry naming its stronger owner), never a SonarCloud status
  change, and never a file-wide ignore.
- Hold size and complexity with ratchets, not repository-wide allowlists. Files
  from eight hundred lines, functions from sixty, and cyclomatic complexity
  above fifteen are debt-entry thresholds, not quality seals: compared per path
  and qualified symbol between base and head, a new violation or the growth of
  an existing one is red, and an unresolvable base is red too.

## Configuration

- Values that vary by user, project, environment, provider, deployment, or
  runtime boundary belong in configuration.
- Do not make stable internal invariants externally configurable just to avoid a
  constant.
- Secrets and API keys enter only through secret or configuration channels.
  Never put them in logs, prompts, briefs, event records, memory,
  documentation, fixtures, or tests.

## Value Ownership

Before adding a literal, constant, default, or fixture value, classify its owner.

- Runtime, user, provider, project, environment, and boundary-specific values
  enter through commands, configuration, environment, fakes, or explicit
  call-site parameters. Do not hardcode prompts, provider output, ids, paths,
  clocks, credentials, or user/project choices.
- Stable domain concepts, protocol tokens, persisted keys, event names,
  statuses, ids, commands, and records need one production owner, preferably a
  typed contract instead of loose strings.
- Adapter representation details stay inside the adapter boundary unless a
  caller has a real contract with them.
- Test values are local scenario data. Use builders, fixtures, or scenario
  objects instead of top-level constants blocks that mix contracts, examples,
  and adapter internals.
- Tests reuse production contracts but do not duplicate production construction,
  serialization, path, or derivation logic to calculate expected results.

## Reuse

- Reuse code only when the same domain idea, owner, and invariant are present.
- Remove duplication when duplicated code must evolve together.
- Hold duplication with a ratchet over a baseline of known pairs: a new
  near-identical function pair is red, an orphaned baseline entry is red, and
  the baseline shrinks in slices with an owner.
- A review of new code asks which existing owner was checked before it was
  written.
- Every required review brief carries the same contract core as the build:
  current item body, candidate diff, and verification evidence; relevant
  rulings and neighbours are folded into the body, not passed as parallel
  truth. Existing risk classes, landing authority, and delta/full-review
  rules still govern.
- Keep short duplication when abstraction would hide meaning or couple unrelated
  concepts.
- Use maintained libraries for solved hard problems when the standard library is
  not enough.
- Do not add a dependency for one trivial helper, style alone, or speculative
  flexibility.
- Explain what complexity a new dependency removes.

## Failure

- Fail loud when durable state, user data, verification, integration, security,
  or process ownership could be corrupted.
- Fail soft only when the failure is visible, recoverable, and cannot corrupt
  important state.
- Validate external input, provider output, configuration, and filesystem state.
- Enforce privileged, irreversible, or external side-effect boundaries in code
  or tool permissions; prompts are not controls.

## Tests

- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- When no production contract exists, define the smallest owner and value
  contract before behavioral tests. Do not let tests invent domain owners,
  protocol values, or adapter details.
- After the contract exists, write the failing behavioral test first for risky
  behavior, implement the smallest behavior, then refactor under the same test.
- For risky behavior, the builder derives that failing test from the ruled
  sentence or approved plan before implementation; existing code may inform
  setup, never the expected result. The independent reviewer judges that test
  against the contract; syntax or mutation metrics become gates only after a
  project pilot proves signal and runtime cost.
- Add focused tests for new behavior and regression tests for bug fixes.
- Put a regression test at the observable boundary that owns the defect; use a
  port fake only when the defect crosses a port boundary.
- Coverage is evidence, not the goal. Do not add tests that only execute lines.
- Keep tests deterministic, cheap, and safe to run in parallel.
- Whenever tests run, use the repository's configured parallel execution.
- Tests must not depend on execution order, shared mutable repository state, or
  process-global state another test can observe.
- Use temporary state or fakes for filesystem, process, network, clock,
  randomness, and external services.
- Core unit tests import no adapter: an adapter-bound module moves whole into
  the integration suite, and a remaining exception carries one registered module
  marker, never a path allowlist. From the first move the count per core
  directory is a ratchet that must not grow, with zero as its target.
- For agent or provider behavior, verify repeatability, perturbation tolerance,
  failure handling, and safety bounds; one successful transcript is not proof.
- For fixture values and expected results, follow Value Ownership.

## Documentation

- Update documentation in the same change that alters behavior, architecture,
  configuration, testing, tooling, or user-visible usage.
- Do not document imagined architecture or future plans as current facts.
- Do not maintain stale-prone inventories, file maps, line references, command
  transcripts, or implementation trivia.
- Describe durable intent, contracts, invariants, and decisions at the highest
  useful abstraction.
- Write for a named reader — human operator, human engineer, or agent — at a
  named altitude; agent docs stay compact contracts, human overviews lead with
  the mental model and prefer one accurate diagram-as-code over structure
  prose.
- Facts have one owner. A document serving another audience is a view:
  derived from the owner, naming its source, corrected by regeneration —
  never independently edited.
- Every line must be accurate and earn its keep.
- Prefer one accurate paragraph over a large stale guide.
- Delete documentation that no longer matches the code.
- Use examples only when they prevent a likely misread.
- Code examples require a real stack, imports, owner, and configuration source.

## Finish

- Read the diff before finishing.
- Remove speculative code, unused code, unused documentation, duplicated
  literals, and hidden hardcoded values.
- Report the exact verification command.
- Mention larger problems separately instead of refactoring unrelated code.

## Self-Improvement

For self-improvement, report the problem removed, proof, complexity added,
verification, and what can now be deleted or simplified. Pure growth is a
defect.
